# Dockerized Cassandra Cluster for Roboconf

This Roboconf recipe allows to deploy a Docker-based cluster of Cassandra nodes
over various (and potentially heterogeneous) infrastructures. Please refer to
the [Docker hub page for Cassandra](https://hub.docker.com/_/cassandra/) more details.

> The default version is Cassandra 2.x.  
> Notice that this version requires all the nodes to use the same ports.
> So, you can create multiple Cassandra instances on a same machine. Not with these recipes. :/
